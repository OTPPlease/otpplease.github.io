Privacy Policy

OTPPlease takes your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how your personal information is collected, used, and protected when you use our OTP forwarding app.

Collection of Information

Our app does not store any messages or personally identifiable information (PII) related to OTPs. When you use our app, it reads the incoming OTP messages on your device in real-time, and forwards them directly to the phone number specified by you. No message data is stored within the app or on any server backend.

Offline and Client-Based Operation

OTPPlease operates solely on your device and does not require an internet connection to function. It is a client-based application designed to provide seamless OTP forwarding without relying on external servers or network connectivity.

Security

We prioritize the security of your personal information. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.

Data Sharing

We do not share any OTP messages or personal information with third parties unless required by law or with your explicit consent.

Data Deletion

Our app does not store any OTP messages or personal information. As a result, there is no need for a separate data deletion process. All OTP messages are forwarded in real-time and are not retained within the app.

We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time, and it is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy periodically. We will notify you of any material changes by placing a prominent notice within the app.
